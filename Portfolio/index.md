*DAVID O. A*


I am a passionate and driven Cybersecurity Professional with a strong focus on Security Engineering. This portfolio showcases my journey toward becoming a Security Engineer, featuring hands-on projects in areas such as Active Directory Security and Incident Response. Through continuous learning, practical experience, and a proactive approach to emerging threats, I strive to design and implement resilient systems that stand strong against todayâ€™s evolving cyber landscape. My goal is to build secure infrastructures that not only detect and respond to threats but also prevent them before they occur.
